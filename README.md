# Bloomberg FOML

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments I completed whilst following [Bloomberg's Foundations of Machine Learning Course](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home)


**UPDATE**

I discontinued this course in favour of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://github.com/coxy1989/isl).
